TO USE THE SERVER YOU NEED A GMAIL ACCOUNT!
Here is how to propely set it up:
 1. Get a Gmail account
 2. Set up 2factor-authentication
 3. Register a new app password here: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
(Use the gamil as normal but with the app password instead of your account password)

Official builds coming once we get something going other than just "save simulator" lol
